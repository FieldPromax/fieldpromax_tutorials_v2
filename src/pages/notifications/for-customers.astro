  <h2>Overview</h2>

    reminders, and when technicians are on their way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Automated communication saves time and money by ensuring every appointment is kept
    and no visits are missed. Customers are always informed and ready when the technician arrives.

  <p>
    Automatically notify customers when the technician taps "In Route" in the mobile app,
    letting them know the technician is on the way.
  </p>

  <h2>Selective Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    You can also send text messages selectively during scheduling to notify customers
    at specific times or based on specific actions.
  </p>

  <h2>Notifications & Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When <strong>"Notify Customer by Text Message"</strong> is enabled, customers receive texts when work is scheduled</li>
    <li>Be careful to ensure visits are accurately scheduled before enabling, as this triggers notifications</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <div class="callout callout-tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Verify the schedule</strong> before turning on notifications to avoid sending incorrect information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Use reminders</strong> to reduce no-shows and ensure customers are prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Customize messages</strong> to reflect your brand and tone.
