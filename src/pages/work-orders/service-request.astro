  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Service requests allow customers to submit work requests directly from your website,
    eliminating the need for phone calls. This ensures no opportunity is missed, even when
    you're away from the office.
  </p>
  <p>
    Customers can fill out a form at their convenience, and the request is instantly converted
    into a work order — streamlining the process and enabling quicker responses.
