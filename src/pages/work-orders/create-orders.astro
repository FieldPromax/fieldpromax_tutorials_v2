  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Work orders are the foundation of Field Promax. They ensure every job is tracked,
    managed, and completed efficiently. This guide covers everything you need to know
    about creating and managing work orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    A well-structured work order captures all essential details — customer information,
    job requirements, scheduling, and billing — keeping your team aligned from start to finish.
