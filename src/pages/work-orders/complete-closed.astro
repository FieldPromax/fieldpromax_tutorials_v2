  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the difference between <strong>Complete</strong> and <strong>Closed</strong> work orders
    is essential for managing your workflow. These statuses act as checkpoints, ensuring everyone stays
    aligned on what's been done and what's left to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Complete status marks progress when a technician finishes a task. Once all tasks are completed,
    the work order can be Closed — either manually or automatically when sent to QuickBooks.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>When a technician finishes a schedule (visit), they mark it as <strong>Complete</strong></li>
    <li>In the Calendar view, completed work orders show a <strong>green checkbox</strong> in the top right corner</li>
    <li>The work order remains open for invoicing and additional schedules if needed</li>

  <ul>
    <li>When all schedules are marked complete, the work order is ready to be closed</li>
    <li>Close a work order using the <strong>Actions</strong> button with one of two options:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Send to QuickBooks:</strong> Closes the work order and generates an invoice in QuickBooks</li>
        <li><strong>Close Only:</strong> Closes the work order without generating an invoice</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the Calendar view, closed work orders appear with a <strong>strikethrough</strong></li>
  </ul>
