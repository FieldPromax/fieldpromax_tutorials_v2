  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Learn how to add and manage users in Field Promax. This guide covers creating users,
    assigning security levels, setting up work groups, and configuring pay rates and QuickBooks item assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proper user management ensures each technician has appropriate access, accurate pay rates,
    and correct settings — leading to smoother workflows and more accurate invoicing.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>From the left panel, go to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Manage Users</strong> → <strong>Create User</strong></li>

  <h3>Security Level</h3>
  <p>
    Select <strong>Service Provider</strong> for your technicians. This gives them access only to
    work orders assigned to them.
  </p>

  <h3>QuickBooks Item Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    Type the first few letters of a product or item from your QuickBooks and select from the list
    (typically "Labor"). This links labor time to the correct line item when generating invoices.
  </p>

  <h3>Phone Number</h3>
  <p>
    Enter the technician's phone number for work order notifications and reminders via text message.
  </p>

  <h2>User Settings</h2>

  <h3>Default Pay Rate</h3>
  <p>
    Set the default pay rate used to calculate labor amounts in invoices.
  </p>

  <h3>Work Groups</h3>
  <p>
    Assign service providers to work groups to filter and view specific groups in the Calendar.
  </p>

  <h3>Technician Color Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    Assign a unique color to each technician for easy visual identification of work orders in the Calendar.
  </p>

  <h3>Show Pricing to Technicians</h3>
  <p>
    Control whether technicians can see pricing details on work orders.
  </p>

  <h2>User Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When a user is created, they receive an email with their login credentials</li>
    <li><strong>Administrators</strong> have full access to all features</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers</strong> only see work orders assigned to them</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <div class="callout callout-tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Set default pay rates</strong> to ensure accurate labor calculations in your invoices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hide pricing from technicians</strong> if you don't want them to see pricing details —
      check the appropriate box in user settings.
