  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This guide explains how technicians can manage work orders in the Field Promax Plus mobile app —
    including recording labor time, adding products, uploading images, capturing signatures, and
    documenting job details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Work orders in the mobile app keep all job details in one place yet are easy to navigate.
    Technicians can quickly access everything they need — from location to documentation,
    product lists, and more — ensuring the job runs smoothly from start to finish.
