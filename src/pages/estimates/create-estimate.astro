<DocsLayout title="Create Estimate" section="Estimates">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Learn how to create estimates in Field Promax, including adding products, adjusting pricing,
    and offering optional products for upselling. Once finalized, send the estimate to your
    customer for approval.
  </p>
  <p>
    By including optional products, you create additional revenue opportunities. Even if only
    a small percentage of customers opt for upsells, it generates extra income. Always review
    the profit analysis before sending to ensure the job remains profitable.
