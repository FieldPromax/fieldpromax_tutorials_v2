  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Generate and send invoices seamlessly using Field Promax and QuickBooks integration.
    You can also send invoices directly from the mobile app while still in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Invoicing doesn't need to wait weeks after a job is done. Generate and send invoices
    the same day the work order is completed, boosting your cash flow and keeping your
    business running smoothly.
