  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Timekeeping module helps you pay technicians accurately and on time.
    It integrates seamlessly with work orders, providing clear visibility into
    technician utilization.
  </p>
  <p>
    By comparing hours paid to technicians with hours billed to customers,
    you can optimize operations — increasing billable hours or reducing payroll
    costs to boost profitability.
  </p>
