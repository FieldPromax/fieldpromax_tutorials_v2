  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This guide explains how service providers can accurately record work hours using
    the Field Promax Plus mobile app — including Clock In, Check In to jobs, logging
    lunch breaks, and Clock Out.
  </p>
  <p>
    With timekeeping integrated into work orders, you get a clear picture of where hours
    are being spent. This keeps things accurate and opens opportunities to improve
    profitability by making better use of time.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>From the hamburger menu in the mobile app, select <strong>Timekeeping</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 1: Clock In</h3>
  <p>At the start of your workday, tap <strong>Clock In</strong> to begin tracking your hours.</p>

  <h3>Step 2: Check In and Out of Jobs</h3>
  <p>
    Use <strong>Check In</strong> and <strong>Check Out</strong> in each work order.
    This time is automatically posted to your timecard.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3: Add Lunch Time</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to the <strong>Timekeeping</strong> section</li>
    <li>Click the three dots in the top right</li>
    <li>Enter the duration of your lunch break</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Step 4: Clock Out and Submit</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>At the end of your workday, tap <strong>Clock Out</strong></li>
    <li>Review your time entries</li>
    <li>Tap <strong>Send for Approval</strong> to submit your logged hours</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Understanding the Difference</h2>
  <div class="callout callout-info">
    <p>
      <strong>Clock In / Clock Out</strong> = Records time so you get paid
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check In / Check Out</strong> = Records time spent on a work order, used to invoice customers
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Notifications & Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Office staff is notified when you submit time for approval</li>
    <li>Once approved, time entries cannot be modified</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <div class="callout callout-tip">
    <p>
      <strong>Always Clock In</strong> at the start of your day and <strong>Clock Out</strong> at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check In and Out</strong> of every job to ensure accurate billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Don't forget to add lunch time</strong> if applicable.
